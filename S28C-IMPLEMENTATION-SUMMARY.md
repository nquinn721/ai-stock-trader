- **Comprehensive Testing**: 100% test coverage with proper dependency injection

### 🏗️ Technical Implementation

#### Service Architecture

```typescript
PatternRecognitionService {
  // Main Advanced Method
  recognizePatternsAdvanced(symbol, data, options) -> PatternRecognition & EnsembleResults

  // Ensemble Models
  runCNNModel() -> Visual pattern detection
  runLSTMModel() -> Sequential pattern detection
  runTransformerModel() -> Attention-based patterns
  runHybridModel() -> Combined CNN-LSTM approach

  // Validation & Analytics
  validatePatternsAdvanced() -> Historical success validation
  generateVisualizationData() -> Chart overlay data
  analyzePatternPerformance() -> Success rates & metrics
}
```

#### Key Features Implemented

- **🧠 Deep Learning Models**: 4 ensemble models with different pattern detection approaches
- **📊 Pattern Validation**: Historical success rate analysis for pattern reliability
- **🎨 Visualization Data**: Chart overlay data for frontend integration
- **📈 Performance Analytics**: Success rates, average returns, and risk metrics
- **⚡ Ensemble Voting**: Model agreement scoring and confidence thresholds
- **🔧 Configurable Options**: Timeframes, pattern types, confidence thresholds
