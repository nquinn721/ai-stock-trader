# Full-Width Dashboard Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully updated the Stock Trading App homepage/dashboard to make the stock data sections fill the total width of the page by removing max-width constraints and centering margins.

## Files Modified

**Changes Made:**

- Removed `max-width: 1400px; margin: 0 auto;` from `.dashboard-content` (line 645)
- Removed `max-width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto;` from `.stocks-grid` (line 1483)
- Removed `max-width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto 2rem;` from `.stocks-section .section-header` (line 1448)
- Removed `max-width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto;` from `.empty-state-wrapper` (line 1491)
- Removed `max-width: 1400px; margin: 0 auto;` from `.hero-content` (line 435)
