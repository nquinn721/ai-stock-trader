# Git Version Control Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines the git workflow and best practices for the Smart AI Stock Trading App project.

## Branch Strategy

### Main Branches

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `staging` - Pre-production testing

### Feature Branches

- `feature/ticket-id-short-description` - New features
- `bugfix/ticket-id-short-description` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/ticket-id-short-description` - Critical production fixes

## Commit Standards

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code formatting changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding/updating tests
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

### Examples

```
feat(trading): implement real-time sentiment analysis

- Add enhanced sentiment lexicon for financial terms
- Implement mock data fallback for NewsAPI
- Add timeout handling for external API calls

Closes #123
```

## Workflow Process

### 1. Create Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/AI-001-sentiment-analysis
```

### 2. Make Changes

- Keep commits small and focused
- Test changes before committing
- Write descriptive commit messages

### 3. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feature/AI-001-sentiment-analysis
# Create Pull Request to develop branch
```

### 4. Code Review

- All code must be reviewed
- Address feedback before merging
- Squash commits if needed

### 5. Merge to Develop

- Use squash merge for feature branches
- Delete feature branch after merge

## Pre-commit Checklist

- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] TypeScript types are correct
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Release Process

### 1. Create Release Branch

```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0
```

### 2. Finalize Release

- Update version numbers
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Final testing

### 3. Merge to Main

```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff release/v1.2.0
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"
```

### 4. Merge Back to Develop

```bash
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/v1.2.0
```

## File Organization Rules

### Directory Structure

```
Stock-Trading-App-Nest/
├── backend/          # NestJS API server
├── frontend/         # React trading interface
├── project-management/ # React project dashboard
├── docs/            # Documentation
├── scripts/         # Build and deployment scripts
└── tests/           # Integration tests
```

### Gitignore Standards

- Node modules
- Environment files
- Build artifacts
- IDE-specific files
- Temporary files

## Emergency Procedures

### Hotfix Process

1. Create hotfix branch from main
2. Apply minimal fix
3. Test thoroughly
4. Merge to main and develop
5. Tag and deploy

### Rollback Process

1. Identify last known good commit
2. Create rollback branch
3. Revert problematic changes
4. Follow normal release process

## Tools and Integration

### Recommended Tools

- Git hooks for pre-commit checks
- Conventional commits validation
- Automated testing on PR
- Code coverage reporting

### Branch Protection Rules

- Require PR reviews
- Require status checks
- Require up-to-date branches
- Restrict pushes to main/develop

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Code Reviews

- Review for logic, performance, security
- Check TypeScript types and imports
- Verify test coverage
- Ensure documentation updates

### Conflict Resolution

- Use rebase for clean history
- Resolve conflicts locally
- Test after resolving conflicts
- Communicate with team about conflicts
