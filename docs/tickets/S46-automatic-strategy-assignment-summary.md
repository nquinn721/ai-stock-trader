# Ticket S46 Created: Automatic Strategy Assignment

## 🎯 Ticket Summary

**ID**: S46  
**Title**: Automatic Strategy Assignment Based on Portfolio Balance  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Epic**: E1 - Core Trading Infrastructure  
**Status**: TODO

## 📋 What This Ticket Accomplishes

### Current Problem ❌

- Users must manually deploy trading strategies before starting autonomous trading
- No automatic compliance with Pattern Day Trader (PDT) regulations
- Complex multi-step process: Deploy Strategy → Configure → Start Trading
- Risk of selecting inappropriate strategy for account balance

### Proposed Solution ✅

- **Single-click trading start**: Just click "Start Trading" - strategy auto-assigned
- **Automatic PDT compliance**: System checks balance and assigns appropriate strategy
- **Smart strategy selection**:
  - **≥$25,000 balance**: Day Trading Strategy (PDT-eligible)
  - **<$25,000 balance**: Swing Trading Strategy (Non-PDT compliant)

## 🔄 User Experience Transformation

### Before (Current Flow)

```

2. Select strategy type (confusing for users)
3. Configure parameters (complex)
4. Deploy strategy (can fail)
5. Click "Start Trading"
6. Hope you selected the right strategy type
```

### After (Simplified Flow)

```
1. Click "Start Trading"
2. ✅ Done! Strategy automatically assigned based on balance
```
