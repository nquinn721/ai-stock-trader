   - Proper class-validator decorators

4. **API Endpoints** (Added to `AutoTradingController`)
   - GET `/api/auto-trading/orders/preview/:portfolioId` - Fetch pending orders
   - POST `/api/auto-trading/orders/approve/:orderId` - Approve order
   - POST `/api/auto-trading/orders/reject/:orderId` - Reject order with reason
   - PUT `/api/auto-trading/orders/:orderId` - Modify order
   - POST `/api/auto-trading/orders/bulk/approve` - Bulk approve orders
   - POST `/api/auto-trading/orders/bulk/reject` - Bulk reject orders
   - GET `/api/auto-trading/orders/summary/:portfolioId` - Order summary
   - POST `/api/auto-trading/orders/cleanup` - Manual EOD cleanup

### Frontend Components

   - Comprehensive order preview dashboard
   - Summary statistics (total orders, value, buy/sell breakdown)
   - Interactive data table with all order details
   - Bulk selection and actions
   - Individual order approval/rejection
   - Detailed order dialog with pricing and reasoning
   - Real-time updates (auto-refresh every 30 seconds)
   - Proper error handling and loading states

2. **Integration with AutonomousTradingPage**
   - Added new "Order Preview" tab
   - Seamless integration with existing portfolio system
   - Automatic portfolio selection for active trading
   - Refresh callbacks to update parent state

3. **Styling** (`frontend/src/components/AutoTradingOrderPreview.css`)
   - Professional UI with hover effects
   - Responsive design for mobile devices
   - Consistent with application theme
   - Visual hierarchy for better UX
