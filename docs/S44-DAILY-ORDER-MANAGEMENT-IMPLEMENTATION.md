```

### Scheduled Operations

#### Cron Jobs Implemented

1. **Market Open Processing** (`25 9 * * 1-5` - 9:25 AM ET, Mon-Fri)
   - Activates pending orders for the trading day
   - Validates order integrity and portfolio status

2. **Market Close Processing** (`0 16 * * 1-5` - 4:00 PM ET, Mon-Fri)
   - Cancels all active DAY orders
   - Updates order statuses and timestamps
   - Broadcasts market close notifications

3. **End-of-Day Processing** (`0 18 * * 1-5` - 6:00 PM ET, Mon-Fri)
   - Processes expired orders
   - Rolls over GTC orders to next trading day
   - Reconciles portfolios and calculates daily performance
   - Generates daily order summaries
   - Cleans up old orders (30+ days)

4. **Hourly Maintenance** (`0 9-16 * * 1-5` - Every hour 9 AM-4 PM ET, Mon-Fri)
   - Checks for order expirations during trading hours
   - Updates order statuses based on market conditions
   - Validates order integrity and consistency

### Key Features

#### Trading Day Validation

- Automatic detection of valid trading days (weekdays)
- Market holiday awareness (extensible for future implementation)
- Skip processing on non-trading days

#### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error logging and tracking
- Graceful degradation during processing failures
- Error collection in EOD processing results

#### WebSocket Notifications

- Real-time market event broadcasts
- Order status update notifications
- EOD processing completion alerts

#### Performance Tracking

- Daily order execution metrics
- Success rate calculations
- Volume and value tracking
- Commission and P&L reconciliation

## Usage Examples

### Get Today's Order Summary

```http
GET /daily-order-management/summary/123/today
```

### Get Order Statistics for 30 Days

```http
GET /daily-order-management/statistics/123?days=30
```

### Force EOD Processing (Admin)

```http
POST /daily-order-management/eod/force
```

### Get Processing Status

```http
GET /daily-order-management/status
```

## Benefits

1. **Automated Order Lifecycle**: Complete automation of order processing from market open to close
2. **Compliance**: Proper handling of DAY vs GTC orders according to market rules
3. **Performance Tracking**: Detailed daily performance metrics and reporting
4. **Risk Management**: Order expiration and validation to prevent stale orders
