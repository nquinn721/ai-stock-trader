# S25: Advanced Order Management System - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the implementation of the Advanced Order Management System (S25) for the Stock Trading App. The system provides comprehensive order management capabilities including market orders, limit orders, stop orders, stop-limit orders, and bracket orders with real-time execution and monitoring.

## Implementation Date

**Completed**: June 22, 2025

## Architecture Overview

### Backend Components

#### 1. Order Entity (`backend/src/entities/order.entity.ts`)

- **Enhanced Features**: Extended the existing Order entity with advanced order types and fields
- **Order Types**: Market, Limit, Stop, Stop-Limit
- **Order Status**: Pending, Triggered, Executed, Cancelled, Expired
- **Additional Fields**: Trigger price, time in force, execution details, parent order ID for bracket orders
- **Validation Methods**: Built-in validation for order states and status checks

#### 2. Order Management Service (`backend/src/modules/order-management/order-management.service.ts`)

- **Core Functionality**:

  - Order creation with validation
  - Order cancellation with reason tracking
  - Real-time order monitoring (cron job every 5 seconds)
  - Order execution based on market conditions
  - Bracket order support (entry + stop-loss + take-profit)
  - Expired order cleanup (daily cron job)

- **Key Methods**:

  - `createOrder()`: Validates and creates orders, executes market orders immediately
  - `cancelOrder()`: Cancels pending orders with reason tracking
  - `monitorAndTriggerOrders()`: Monitors market prices and triggers conditional orders
  - `createBracketOrder()`: Creates three linked orders for complete position management
  - `getOrderBook()`: Returns all active orders for real-time display

- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Paper Trading Service for order execution

#### 3. Order Management Controller (`backend/src/modules/order-management/order-management.controller.ts`)

- **REST Endpoints**:
  - `POST /order-management/orders`: Create new orders
  - `GET /order-management/portfolios/:portfolioId/orders`: Get orders by portfolio
  - `GET /order-management/orders/active`: Get all active orders
  - `DELETE /order-management/orders/:orderId`: Cancel orders
  - `POST /order-management/orders/bracket`: Create bracket orders
  - `GET /order-management/portfolios/:portfolioId/orders/statistics`: Order statistics

#### 4. WebSocket Integration (`backend/src/modules/websocket/websocket.gateway.ts`)

- **Real-time Events**:

  - `create_order`: Handle order creation via WebSocket
  - `cancel_order`: Handle order cancellation via WebSocket
  - `get_order_book`: Send current order book to clients
  - `order_created`: Broadcast new orders to all clients
  - `order_executed`: Broadcast order executions with details
  - `order_book_update`: Real-time order book updates

- **Event Emission**: Order Management Service emits WebSocket events for:
  - Order execution notifications
  - Order execution failures
  - Portfolio-specific order updates

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Order Management Component (`frontend/src/components/OrderManagement.tsx`)

- **Features**:

  - Real-time order book display
  - Order creation dialog
  - Order cancellation
  - Status tracking with color-coded chips
  - Portfolio filtering
  - Real-time WebSocket updates

- **UI Elements**:
  - Comprehensive order table with all order details
  - Status indicators (pending, triggered, executed, cancelled)
  - Action buttons for order management
  - Success/error notifications via Snackbar

#### 2. Create Order Form (`frontend/src/components/CreateOrderForm.tsx`)

- **Order Types**: Full support for market, limit, stop, and stop-limit orders
- **Validation**: Client-side validation with real-time error display
- **Advanced Options**: Time in force, trigger prices, order notes
- **Order Summary**: Real-time preview of order details before submission
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly form layout using MUI Stack

#### 3. Portfolio Integration (`frontend/src/components/Portfolio.tsx`)

- **Seamless Integration**: Order management added as dedicated section
- **Context Sharing**: Shares portfolio context for order creation
- **Real-time Updates**: Orders update in real-time as portfolio changes

#### 4. Type Definitions (`frontend/src/types/index.ts`)

- **Comprehensive Types**: Full TypeScript support for all order-related interfaces
- **WebSocket Events**: Typed event definitions for type-safe WebSocket communication
- **DTOs**: Data transfer objects for order creation and updates

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Advanced Order Types**

- **Market Orders**: Execute immediately at current market price
- **Limit Orders**: Execute only when price reaches specified limit
- **Stop Orders**: Execute when price crosses stop threshold
- **Stop-Limit Orders**: Convert to limit order when stop price is reached

### 2. **Automatic Order Execution**

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Cron job monitors market prices every 5 seconds
- **Trigger Logic**: Sophisticated trigger conditions for different order types
- **Execution Integration**: Seamless integration with paper trading system
- **Commission Calculation**: Automatic commission calculation (0.1% of trade value)

### 3. **Order Status Tracking**

- **Comprehensive Status**: Pending → Triggered → Executed/Cancelled/Expired
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket notifications for all status changes
- **Execution Details**: Tracks execution price, quantity, timestamp, and reason

### 4. **Bracket Orders**

- **Three-Order Strategy**: Entry + Stop-Loss + Take-Profit in single operation
- **Linked Orders**: Parent-child relationship for proper order management
- **Risk Management**: Automatic stop-loss and take-profit execution

### 5. **Real-time Communication**

- **WebSocket Events**: Comprehensive event system for real-time updates
- **Portfolio Integration**: Orders update portfolio P&L in real-time
- **Client Notifications**: Immediate feedback for all order operations

### 6. **Portfolio Integration**

- **P&L Tracking**: Order executions automatically update portfolio performance
- **Position Management**: Orders properly update position quantities and values
- **Cash Management**: Automatic cash balance updates on order execution

## Configuration & Setup

- **WebSocket Optimization**: Targeted event emission to reduce bandwidth

### Frontend Optimizations

- **Component Optimization**: Efficient React component rendering
- **WebSocket Management**: Proper event listener cleanup
- **State Management**: Optimized state updates for real-time data

## Security Considerations

### Backend Security

- **Authorization**: Portfolio-based authorization (implicit through portfolio ownership)
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without sensitive data exposure

### Frontend Security

- **Input Sanitization**: Form validation prevents invalid data submission
- **WebSocket Security**: Secure WebSocket connections
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage prevents runtime errors

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Advanced Order Types**: OCO (One-Cancels-Other), Iceberg orders
2. **Order Routing**: Multiple exchange support
3. **Advanced Risk Management**: Position sizing, portfolio-level risk limits
4. **Order Analytics**: Execution quality metrics, slippage analysis
5. **Mobile App**: Dedicated mobile interface for order management

### Technical Debt

- Consider implementing order persistence for historical analysis
- Add order modification capabilities (price/quantity updates)
- Implement advanced order algorithms (TWAP, VWAP)
