# ADR-010: UI Theme and Layout Consistency Standards

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-06-27

## Context

The Stock Trading App has grown to include multiple pages with different layouts and styling approaches, leading to:

1. **Inconsistent User Experience**: Different pages have varying header structures, color schemes, and layout patterns
2. **Maintenance Overhead**: Duplicate styling code across components without centralized standards
3. **Development Inefficiency**: Developers spending time creating unique layouts instead of following patterns
4. **Accessibility Issues**: Inconsistent focus states, color contrasts, and responsive behaviors
5. **Brand Dilution**: Lack of cohesive visual identity across the application

The dashboard page has established a successful design pattern with:

- Consistent header structure with live indicators
- Unified color system and typography
- Responsive layout patterns
- Smooth animations and interactions
- Professional glassmorphism design aesthetic

## Decision

We adopt the dashboard layout and styling as the **mandatory standard** for all pages in the application.

### Core Requirements

1. **Universal Header Structure**: Every page must implement a standardized header following the dashboard pattern
2. **Consistent Theme System**: All pages must use the centralized CSS variables and shared styling
3. **Standardized Layout Patterns**: Grid systems, card layouts, and component structures must follow established patterns
4. **Unified Animation Library**: All pages must use the approved animation keyframes and timing
5. **Responsive Design Standards**: Consistent breakpoints and mobile-first approach

### Implementation Standards

1. **CSS Architecture**:
   - Import `shared-styles.css` in every page stylesheet
   - Use CSS Variables for all colors, spacing, and typography
   - Follow BEM-like naming conventions for components

2. **Layout Structure**:
   - `.page-container` as the root wrapper
   - `.page-header` with standardized left/right sections
   - `.dashboard-content` for main content area

3. **Component Patterns**:
   - Glass-morphism cards with consistent border-radius
   - Gradient text treatments for headers
   - Unified button styles with hover states
   - Consistent form input styling

4. **Grid System**:
   - **PROHIBITED**: Material-UI Grid components (due to version conflicts)
   - **REQUIRED**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for all layouts
   - Responsive grid patterns with auto-fit columns

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Consistent navigation patterns across all pages
   - Unified visual language increases usability
   - Predictable interaction patterns

2. **Faster Development**:
   - Reusable component patterns reduce development time
   - Clear standards eliminate design decision paralysis
   - Copy-paste template implementations

3. **Easier Maintenance**:
   - Centralized theme system simplifies global updates
   - Consistent structure makes bug fixes more predictable
   - Reduced CSS duplication and conflicts

4. **Better Accessibility**:
   - Standardized focus states and color contrasts
   - Consistent keyboard navigation patterns
   - Unified responsive behavior

5. **Professional Appearance**:
   - Cohesive brand identity across the application
   - Modern glassmorphism aesthetic
   - Enterprise-grade visual consistency

### Negative Consequences

1. **Initial Refactoring Overhead**:
   - Existing pages need updates to match standards
   - Some custom layouts may need redesign
   - Temporary development velocity reduction

2. **Design Constraints**:
   - Limited flexibility for unique page requirements
   - May not suit all content types perfectly
   - Could stifle creative design solutions

3. **Learning Curve**:
   - Developers need to familiarize themselves with standards
   - Requires discipline to follow patterns consistently
   - Code review overhead to enforce compliance

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Documentation and Standards (Complete)

- [x] Create comprehensive UI standards documentation
- [x] Document required CSS patterns and component structures
- [x] Establish code review guidelines for UI consistency

### Phase 2: Template Creation

- [ ] Create page templates for common layouts
- [ ] Build reusable header component
- [ ] Establish shared component library

### Phase 3: Existing Page Migration

- [ ] Audit all existing pages for compliance
- [ ] Prioritize high-traffic pages for updates
- [ ] Gradual migration with A/B testing

### Phase 4: Enforcement and Tools

- [ ] Add ESLint rules for CSS pattern enforcement
- [ ] Create development tools for pattern validation
- [ ] Integrate checks into CI/CD pipeline

## Compliance Requirements

### Mandatory Elements

1. **Header Structure**: Must include standardized header with navigation and status indicators
2. **Color System**: Must use CSS variables from shared-styles.css
3. **Layout Patterns**: Must use approved grid and flexbox patterns
4. **Responsive Design**: Must implement standard breakpoints and mobile behavior
5. **Animation Standards**: Must use approved keyframes and timing functions

### Quality Gates

1. **Code Review**: All UI changes must be reviewed for standards compliance
2. **Visual Testing**: Screenshots must be taken to verify consistent appearance
3. **Responsive Testing**: Must test on standard device sizes
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Must verify keyboard navigation and color contrast

### Monitoring and Metrics

1. **Consistency Score**: Track percentage of pages following standards
2. **Development Velocity**: Monitor impact on feature delivery speed
3. **User Feedback**: Collect usability feedback on navigation consistency
4. **Bug Rates**: Track UI-related bugs and inconsistencies
