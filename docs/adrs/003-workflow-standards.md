# ADR-003: Workflow and Process Standards

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Efficient development workflows are essential for productivity and maintaining code quality. This includes file management, development processes, testing strategies, and deployment procedures.

## Decision

We establish the following workflow and process standards:

### Development Workflow

- **Hot Reload**: Leave both client and server running during development
- **No Restart Required**: Code changes automatically reflected without manual restarts
- **Timeout Policy**: No process should hang longer than 10 seconds
- **File Management**: Close files in IDE after editing to maintain clean workspace

### File and Project Organization

- **Root Directory**: Keep minimal files in project root
- **Cleanup Policy**: Move unnecessary files from root to appropriate directories
- **Empty Files**: Remove all empty files during cleanup
- **Test Organization**: Single test folder structure, move test files from root when complete
- **NEEDREMOVED**: Temporary directory for files pending deletion

### Git and Version Control

- **Commit Frequency**: Commit when git changes exceed 15 files
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches for significant changes
- **Change Management**: Careful not to break working functionality when making unrelated changes

### Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Unit Tests**: Required for both server and client components
- **API Testing**: Comprehensive API endpoint testing
- **Playwright Tests**: End-to-end testing for critical user flows
- **Swagger Documentation**: All API endpoints must be documented
- **Visual Testing**: Screenshots after updates to check for layout issues

### Process Management

- **Port Management**: Kill conflicting processes using `taskkill` command
- **Terminal Usage**: Reuse existing terminals when possible, only open new for dedicated processes
- **Network Commands**: Use `netstat` for port checking, `curl` for API testing

## Consequences

### Positive

- Streamlined development process with minimal interruptions
- Consistent project organization and maintainability
- Comprehensive testing coverage
- Automatic documentation through Swagger

### Negative

- Additional overhead for file organization and cleanup
- Stricter commit and testing requirements
- More complex setup for comprehensive testing suite

## Implementation Notes

- Automated scripts for cleanup and file organization
- Pre-commit hooks for testing and linting
- Regular review of project structure and processes
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing
