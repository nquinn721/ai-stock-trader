# ADR-007: Testing Infrastructure and Standards

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Stock Trading App requires comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and maintainability as it handles real financial data and trading operations. We need standardized testing practices across backend services, frontend components, and end-to-end user workflows.

Key requirements:

- Real-time data validation from Yahoo Finance API
- WebSocket connection testing and reliability
- Portfolio performance accuracy
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance under load
- Error handling and recovery

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive testing infrastructure with the following components:

### Testing Framework Stack

- **Backend**: Jest with NestJS testing utilities
- **Frontend**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **E2E**: Playwright for cross-browser testing
- **API Integration**: Supertest with NestJS

### Test Categories and Coverage Goals

1. **Unit Tests** (Target: 85-90% coverage)

   - Backend services and controllers
   - Frontend components and hooks
   - Utility functions and helpers

2. **Integration Tests** (Target: 100% endpoint coverage)

   - API endpoint testing
   - Database integration
   - External API mocking (Yahoo Finance)

3. **E2E Tests** (Target: 95% critical user flows)
   - Complete user workflows
   - Cross-browser compatibility
   - Performance benchmarks

### Testing Workflow

- **Development**: Run `.\quick-test.ps1` after code changes
- **Pre-commit**: Run `.\run-all-tests.ps1` full suite
- **CI/CD**: Automated test execution on commits
- **Manual**: API endpoint validation with curl

### Test Environment Standards

- Mock external APIs (Yahoo Finance) in unit tests
- Use test databases for integration tests
- Consistent test data across environments
- Automated test cleanup and isolation

### Performance Testing Requirements

- API response times < 200ms
- WebSocket latency < 50ms
- Frontend rendering < 2 seconds
- Database queries < 100ms

## Consequences

### Positive

- High confidence in code changes and deployments
- Early detection of bugs and regressions
- Documented behavior through test cases
- Improved code quality through test-driven development
- Reliable performance benchmarks

### Negative

- Increased development time for test writing
- Additional maintenance overhead for test updates
- CI/CD pipeline complexity
- Learning curve for comprehensive testing practices

### Mitigation

- Automated test generation where possible
- Clear testing guidelines and examples
- Regular test suite maintenance
- Performance monitoring and optimization
