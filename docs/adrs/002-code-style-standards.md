# ADR-002: Code Style and Quality Standards

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Maintaining consistent code quality and style across the project is crucial for maintainability, readability, and collaboration between human developers and AI assistants.

## Decision

We establish the following code style and quality standards:

### TypeScript Requirements

- **Mandatory**: All React components must use TypeScript (`.tsx` files)
- **Prohibited**: No `.js` files in the React application
- **Backend**: NestJS with strict TypeScript configuration
- **Type Safety**: Prefer explicit types over `any` where possible

### File Organization

- Components in dedicated directories with associated CSS files
- Services and modules follow NestJS conventions
- Entities and DTOs properly typed and exported
- Test files in dedicated test directories (not in root)

### Code Quality Standards

- Consistent indentation and formatting
- Meaningful variable and function names
- Proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Comments for complex business logic
- No unused imports or variables

### Architecture Patterns

- **Backend**: Modular architecture with proper dependency injection
- **Frontend**: Component-based architecture with proper separation of concerns
- **State Management**: React hooks and context where appropriate
- **API Integration**: Consistent error handling and response formatting

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved code maintainability and readability
- Reduced bugs through type safety
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Better IDE support and autocompletion

### Negative

- Stricter development constraints
- Additional time needed for proper typing
- Learning curve for developers new to TypeScript

## Implementation Guidelines

- Use ESLint and Prettier for automated code formatting
- Implement pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
- Regular code reviews to ensure standards compliance
- Documentation updates when patterns change
