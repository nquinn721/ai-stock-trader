### Advanced Features

#### Real-time Streaming

```typescript
extractFeaturesRealTime(symbol: string): Observable<FeatureSet>
```

- Observable-based feature streaming

#### Feature Validation

```typescript
validateFeatures(featureSet: FeatureSet): FeatureValidationResult
```

- NaN/infinite value detection

- Category-based feature grouping
- Detailed feature descriptions

#### Performance Optimization

- **Caching**: LRU cache for computed features
- **Batching**: Configurable batch processing
- **Real-time Mode**: Optimized processing for live trading
- **Memory Management**: Efficient window-based calculations

### Configuration Options

```typescript
interface FeaturePipelineConfig {
  timeframes: string[]; // ['1m', '5m', '15m', '1h', '1d']
  indicators: string[]; // List of 40+ available indicators
  lookbackPeriods: number[]; // [10, 20, 50, 100, 200]
  enableRealTime: boolean; // WebSocket streaming
  batchSize: number; // Processing batch size
  cacheFeatures: boolean; // Feature caching
  validateQuality: boolean; // Feature validation
  performanceMode: string; // 'realtime' | 'optimized'
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Multi-timeframe Aggregation

- Automatic data aggregation from 1-minute to higher timeframes
- OHLCV data preservation during aggregation
- Timestamp alignment and interval grouping

### Data Quality Assessment

- Configurable data quality scoring
- Gap detection with tolerance thresholds
- Price data validation (OHLC consistency)
- Minimum quality thresholds (0.85+)

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Graceful degradation for insufficient data
- Detailed logging with performance metrics
- Fallback values for edge cases

## Performance Characteristics

- **Processing Speed**: <100ms for 200 data points
- **Memory Efficiency**: Window-based calculations
- **Real-time Latency**: <50ms for feature updates
- **Scalability**: Supports 1000+ symbols with caching

## Integration Points

### ML Model Integration

```typescript
// Example usage for ML model training
const features = await featurePipelineService.extractFeatures(
  marketData,
  "AAPL",
  { performanceMode: "optimized" }
);
```

### Real-time Trading Integration

```typescript
// Example usage for live trading
featurePipelineService
  .extractFeaturesRealTime("AAPL")
  .subscribe((featureSet) => {
    // Process real-time features for trading decisions
  });
```
