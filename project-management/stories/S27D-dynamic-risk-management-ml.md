### Core Components Implemented

#### 1. Risk Assessment Engine

- **Multi-factor risk scoring**: Combines market volatility, correlation analysis, and momentum indicators
- **Real-time calculation**: Continuously updates risk scores as market conditions change
- **Portfolio-level aggregation**: Considers inter-asset correlations and portfolio concentration

#### 2. Dynamic Position Sizing

- **Volatility-adjusted sizing**: Automatically adjusts position sizes based on asset volatility
- **Kelly Criterion implementation**: Optimal position sizing based on expected returns and risk
- **Portfolio heat mapping**: Prevents over-concentration in any single asset or sector

#### 3. Adaptive Stop-Loss System

- **Volatility-based stops**: Stop-loss levels adjust based on recent volatility patterns
- **Trailing stop optimization**: Dynamic trailing stops that adapt to trend strength
- **Time-based adjustments**: Stop levels that consider time decay and option-like behaviors

#### 4. Real-time Monitoring

- **Continuous risk tracking**: Real-time monitoring of portfolio risk metrics
- **Alert system integration**: Automatic notifications when risk thresholds are breached
- **Performance attribution**: Tracks risk-adjusted returns and Sharpe ratio optimization

#### 5. Stress Testing Framework

- **Scenario analysis**: Tests portfolio performance under various market stress scenarios
- **Monte Carlo simulations**: Probabilistic analysis of potential portfolio outcomes
- **Historical backtesting**: Validates risk models against historical market events

}
```

#### Key Features Implemented

##### 1. Multi-Dimensional Risk Scoring

- **Market risk**: Volatility, beta, correlation analysis
- **Liquidity risk**: Bid-ask spreads, volume analysis
- **Concentration risk**: Position size limits, sector exposure
- **Temporal risk**: Time-based risk decay modeling

##### 2. Advanced Position Sizing Algorithms

- **Kelly Criterion optimization**: Mathematical optimization for position sizing
- **Risk parity approach**: Equal risk contribution across positions
- **Volatility targeting**: Maintains consistent portfolio volatility
- **Correlation adjustments**: Reduces position sizes for highly correlated assets

##### 3. Intelligent Stop-Loss Management

- **ATR-based stops**: Uses Average True Range for volatility-adjusted stops
- **Support/resistance integration**: Incorporates technical levels
- **Momentum-based adjustments**: Tighter stops in weak trends, looser in strong trends
- **Time-weighted adjustments**: Considers holding period in stop-loss calculation

##### 4. Comprehensive Risk Monitoring

- **Real-time VaR calculation**: Value at Risk monitoring with multiple confidence levels
- **Drawdown protection**: Automatic position reduction during significant drawdowns
- **Correlation monitoring**: Tracks changing correlations between portfolio holdings
- **Exposure limits**: Enforces maximum exposure limits by asset, sector, and geography

##### 5. Advanced Stress Testing

- **Historical scenario replay**: Tests against major historical market events
- **Custom scenario creation**: User-defined stress test scenarios
- **Tail risk analysis**: Focus on extreme negative events
- **Recovery time estimation**: Estimates time to recover from stress events

### Integration Points

#### 1. Trading System Integration

- **Pre-trade risk checks**: Validates trades against risk limits before execution
- **Real-time position monitoring**: Continuous tracking of position risk
- **Automatic risk adjustments**: Triggers position changes when risk limits are breached

#### 2. Portfolio Management Integration

- **Risk-adjusted optimization**: Portfolio optimization considers risk-adjusted returns
- **Rebalancing triggers**: Risk-based rebalancing recommendations
- **Performance attribution**: Risk-adjusted performance measurement

#### 3. Alert and Notification System

- **Risk threshold alerts**: Notifications when risk limits are approached
- **Performance degradation alerts**: Warns of declining risk-adjusted performance
- **Market regime change alerts**: Notifications of changing market conditions

### Performance Metrics

#### 1. Risk-Adjusted Returns

- **Sharpe ratio optimization**: Maximizes risk-adjusted returns
- **Sortino ratio tracking**: Focuses on downside risk management
- **Calmar ratio monitoring**: Risk-adjusted returns considering maximum drawdown

#### 2. Risk Control Effectiveness

- **VaR accuracy**: Backtests Value at Risk predictions
- **Stop-loss effectiveness**: Measures stop-loss hit rates and slippage
- **Drawdown reduction**: Quantifies reduction in maximum drawdowns

#### 3. Portfolio Stability

- **Volatility control**: Maintains target portfolio volatility
- **Correlation stability**: Monitors and manages correlation drift
- **Exposure management**: Tracks adherence to exposure limits

### Business Impact

#### 1. Risk Reduction
