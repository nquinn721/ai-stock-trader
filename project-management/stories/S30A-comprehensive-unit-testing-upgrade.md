- **Story ID**: S30A
- **Epic**: Testing & Quality Assurance Enhancement
- **Sprint**: Sprint 5
- **Story Points**: 8
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assignee**: Development Team
- **Created**: 2025-06-24
- **Updated**: 2025-06-24

## Description

Upgrade and expand unit testing coverage throughout the entire application to achieve 95%+ coverage across all modules. This includes updating existing tests, adding missing test cases, and implementing comprehensive testing patterns for all services, controllers, components, and utilities.

## Business Value

- Improved code reliability and stability
- Reduced bugs in production
- Faster development cycles with confidence in changes
- Better maintainability and refactoring safety
- Enhanced code documentation through tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All DTOs and entities have validation tests
- [ ] All utility functions have comprehensive tests
- [ ] Integration tests for complex service interactions
- [ ] Mock external API calls (Yahoo Finance, News API)
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Performance testing for critical endpoints

### Frontend Testing Requirements

- [ ] All React components have 95%+ test coverage
- [ ] All custom hooks have complete test coverage
- [ ] All utility functions have comprehensive tests
- [ ] Integration tests for component interactions
- [ ] Mock API calls and external dependencies
- [ ] Test user interactions and event handling
- [ ] Test responsive design and accessibility
- [ ] Snapshot testing for UI consistency

### Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] Update Jest configuration for optimal coverage reporting
- [ ] Implement test data factories and fixtures
- [ ] Create reusable testing utilities and helpers
- [ ] Set up automated coverage reporting
- [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks for test validation
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking tests
- [ ] Create comprehensive test documentation

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Testing Stack

```typescript
// Required testing libraries
- Jest (unit testing framework)
- @nestjs/testing (NestJS testing utilities)
- supertest (HTTP assertion library)
- @types/jest (TypeScript definitions)
- jest-mock-extended (advanced mocking)
```

### Frontend Testing Stack

```typescript
// Required testing libraries
- Jest (unit testing framework)
- @testing-library/react (React testing utilities)
- @testing-library/jest-dom (DOM matchers)
- @testing-library/user-event (user interaction simulation)
- msw (Mock Service Worker for API mocking)
```

### Coverage Targets

- **Overall Coverage**: 95%+
- **Statements**: 95%+
- **Branches**: 90%+
- **Functions**: 95%+
- **Lines**: 95%+

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Testing Enhancement (3 days)

1. Audit existing backend tests
2. Update ML module service tests
3. Enhance paper-trading module tests
4. Add comprehensive stock service tests
5. Create integration tests for complex workflows

### Phase 2: Frontend Testing Enhancement (3 days)

1. Audit existing frontend tests
2. Add component tests for all new components
3. Create comprehensive hook tests
4. Add integration tests for user workflows
5. Implement visual regression testing

### Phase 3: Testing Infrastructure (2 days)

1. Configure advanced Jest settings
2. Set up coverage reporting and CI integration
3. Create test data factories
4. Implement automated test validation
5. Document testing best practices

## Files to Modify

### Backend Test Files

```
backend/src/modules/ml/services/*.spec.ts (update all)
backend/src/modules/paper-trading/*.spec.ts (enhance)
backend/src/modules/stock/*.spec.ts (enhance)
backend/src/modules/news/*.spec.ts (create/update)
backend/test/ (integration tests)
```

### Frontend Test Files

```
frontend/src/components/*.test.tsx (update all)
frontend/src/hooks/*.test.ts (create)
frontend/src/services/*.test.ts (create)
frontend/src/stores/*.test.ts (create for future MobX)
```

### Configuration Files

```
backend/jest.config.js (enhance)
frontend/src/setupTests.ts (enhance)
.github/workflows/ (add test automation)
```

## Dependencies

- No external dependencies
- Requires existing Jest and testing library setup
- May need additional testing utility packages

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] Coverage reports show 95%+ overall coverage
- [ ] No flaky or intermittent test failures
- [ ] Tests run in under 30 seconds for unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests complete in under 2 minutes
- [ ] All team members can run tests locally
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline includes automated test validation
- [ ] Test documentation is complete and accessible

## Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Technical Risks**: Large codebase may have complex testing scenarios
- **Mitigation**: Incremental approach, focus on critical paths first
- **Dependencies**: None blocking

## Notes

- This story focuses on comprehensive testing coverage
- Should be completed before implementing MobX migration (S30B)
- Tests will provide safety net for upcoming architectural changes
- Consider implementing property-based testing for complex algorithms
