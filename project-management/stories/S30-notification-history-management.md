  type: NotificationTypeEnum;
  title: string;
  message: string;
  priority: PriorityEnum;
  status: NotificationStatusEnum;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
  tags: string[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  readAt?: Date;
  archivedAt?: Date;
  expiresAt?: Date;
}

interface NotificationAnalytics {
  totalNotifications: number;
  readRate: number;
  avgResponseTime: number;
  typeDistribution: Record<string, number>;

  // Export functionality with format selection
  async exportNotifications(
    userId: string,
    format: ExportFormat,
    filters: NotificationFilters
  );
}
```

### Database Optimizations
