## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Details

### Core Service Integration

```typescript
class IntelligentRecommendationService {
  // S28D: Feature Pipeline Integration
  extractFeatures(symbol: string): Promise<FeatureSet[]>;

  // S29A: Market Prediction Integration
  getPricePredictions(symbol: string): Promise<MarketPrediction>;

  // S29B: Signal Generation Integration
  getEnsembleSignals(symbol: string): Promise<TradingSignal[]>;

  // S29C: Real-time Updates Integration
  getAdaptiveModels(symbol: string): Promise<ModelUpdate>;

  // S29D: Ensemble Orchestration Integration
  orchestrateModels(symbol: string): Promise<EnsembleResult>;

  // Unified Recommendation Generation
  generateRecommendation(symbol: string): Promise<TradingRecommendation>;
}
```

### Multi-Factor Scoring Algorithm

1. **Technical Score** (30%): RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, moving averages
2. **Pattern Score** (25%): Chart patterns, candlestick patterns, breakouts
3. **ML Prediction Score** (25%): Ensemble model predictions with confidence
4. **Sentiment Score** (10%): News sentiment and market mood
5. **Volume Score** (10%): Volume confirmation and strength analysis

### Risk-Adjusted Recommendations

- **Position Sizing**: Kelly Criterion + volatility adjustment
- **Stop Loss**: ATR-based + technical level validation
- **Take Profit**: Risk/reward ratio optimization (minimum 1:2)
- **Portfolio Impact**: Correlation analysis and concentration limits
