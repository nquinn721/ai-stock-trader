## Progress Notes

**Components Migrated to MobX:**

- âœ… Dashboard.tsx - Full migration completed
- âœ… StockModal.tsx - Full migration completed

**Components Still Using Direct API Calls:**

- ðŸ”„ StockCard.tsx - Uses fetch() for historical data
- ðŸ”„ QuickTrade.tsx - Uses axios for portfolio/trading operations
- ðŸ”„ PriceChart.tsx - Uses fetch() for chart data
- ðŸ”„ PortfolioSelector.tsx - Uses axios for portfolio data
- ðŸ”„ PortfolioList.tsx - Uses axios for CRUD operations
- ðŸ”„ PortfolioDetailsModal.tsx - Uses axios for performance data

**Key Achievements:**

- Successfully migrated Dashboard component from SocketContext to MobX stores
- Added stocksWithSignals computed property to StockStore
- Added fetchStockDetails and fetchStockHistory methods to StockStore
- Created comprehensive MobX test suite for Dashboard component
- Maintained full TypeScript type safety during migration
- All builds are successful with only ESLint warnings (no compilation errors)

## Technical Requirements

### MobX Setup

```typescript
// Required dependencies
- mobx (state management library)
- mobx-react-lite (React integration)
- mobx-persist-store (persistence layer)
- @types/mobx (TypeScript definitions)
```

### Store Architecture

```typescript
// Store structure
src/stores/
â”œâ”€â”€ StockStore.ts         // Stock data and real-time updates
â”œâ”€â”€ PortfolioStore.ts     // Portfolio management and performance
â”œâ”€â”€ RecommendationStore.ts // AI recommendations and signals
â”œâ”€â”€ UserStore.ts          // User preferences and settings
â”œâ”€â”€ WebSocketStore.ts     // WebSocket connection management
â”œâ”€â”€ RootStore.ts          // Store composition and injection
â””â”€â”€ index.ts              // Store exports and setup
```

### API Service Layer

```typescript
// Service layer for API communication
src/services/
â”œâ”€â”€ stockService.ts       // Stock-related API calls
â”œâ”€â”€ portfolioService.ts   // Portfolio API operations
â”œâ”€â”€ recommendationService.ts // Recommendation API calls
â”œâ”€â”€ webSocketService.ts   // WebSocket connection management
â””â”€â”€ apiClient.ts          // Base API client configuration
```

## Dependencies

- Requires S30A (Unit Testing) to be completed first
- MobX library installation and configuration
- May require React Context API updates
- WebSocket service refactoring

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All data logic moved from components to stores
- [ ] Zero direct API calls remaining in React components
- [ ] All stores have comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show improvement
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented throughout
- [ ] WebSocket connections managed by stores
- [ ] Caching strategies implemented and tested
- [ ] TypeScript types properly defined for all stores

- [ ] All existing functionality preserved

## Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: High
- **Technical Risks**: Large architectural change affecting many components
- **Mitigation**: Incremental migration, comprehensive testing, feature flags
- **Dependencies**: Critical to complete testing first (S30A)

## Notes

- This is a significant architectural change requiring careful planning
- Should be implemented incrementally to minimize risk
- Consider using feature flags for gradual rollout
- Performance monitoring should be implemented during migration
- Team training on MobX patterns may be required
