  id: string;
  portfolioId: string;
  symbol: string;
  strategy: "BRACKET" | "OCO" | "TRAILING_STOP" | "CONDITIONAL";

  // Primary order
  primaryOrder: {
    side: "BUY" | "SELL";
    quantity: number;
    orderType: "MARKET" | "LIMIT" | "STOP_LIMIT";
    limitPrice?: number;
    stopPrice?: number;
  };

  // Risk management orders
  stopLoss?: {
    price: number;
    type: "FIXED" | "TRAILING" | "ADAPTIVE";
    trailAmount?: number;
    trailPercent?: number;
  };

  takeProfit?: {
    price: number;
    type: "LIMIT" | "MARKET_ON_CLOSE";
    partialFillLevels?: Array<{ percentage: number; price: number }>;
  };

  // Advanced features
  conditional?: {
    triggers: ConditionalTrigger[];
    logicalOperator: "AND" | "OR";
  };

  // Risk parameters
  riskManagement: {
    maxPositionSize: number;
    portfolioRiskPercent: number;
    correlationLimit: number;
    maxDailyLoss: number;
  };

  // Recommendation context
  recommendationData: {
    recommendationId: string;
    confidence: number;
    reasoning: string[];
    riskLevel: "LOW" | "MEDIUM" | "HIGH";
    timeHorizon: "1D" | "1W" | "1M";
  };

  // Execution metadata
  createdAt: Date;
  expiryTime: Date;
  status: OrderExecutionStatus;
  executionDetails?: OrderExecutionDetails;
}
```

### Smart Position Sizing Algorithm

```typescript
interface PositionSizingInput {
  portfolioValue: number;
  availableCash: number;
  currentPrice: number;
  volatility: number;
  confidence: number;
  riskLevel: "LOW" | "MEDIUM" | "HIGH";
  correlationWithPortfolio: number;
  maxPositionPercent: number;
}

interface PositionSizingOutput {
  recommendedShares: number;
  positionValue: number;
  portfolioPercentage: number;
  kellyFraction: number;
  confidenceAdjustment: number;
  volatilityAdjustment: number;
  riskScore: number;
}
```

### Adaptive Stop-Loss Engine

```typescript
interface AdaptiveStopLoss {
  symbol: string;
  entryPrice: number;
  currentPrice: number;
  volatility: number;
  marketTrend: "BULL" | "BEAR" | "SIDEWAYS";
  positionAge: number; // hours since entry

  // Output
  stopLossPrice: number;
  stopLossType: "ATR_BASED" | "PERCENTAGE" | "SUPPORT_RESISTANCE";
  trailingDistance: number;
  riskRewardRatio: number;
}
```
