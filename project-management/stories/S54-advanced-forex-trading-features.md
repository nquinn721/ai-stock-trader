## Technical Requirements

### 1. Leverage Management System

#### Margin Calculation Engine

```typescript
interface ForexLeverageConfig {
  maxLeverage: number; // e.g., 100:1, 50:1, 30:1
  marginRequirement: number; // percentage of position value
  maintenanceMargin: number; // minimum margin percentage
  marginCallThreshold: number; // when to trigger margin call
}

interface MarginCalculation {
  requiredMargin: number;
  availableMargin: number;
  usedMargin: number;
  marginLevel: number; // percentage
  isMarginCallRequired: boolean;
}
```

#### Leverage Controls

- Dynamic leverage based on currency pair volatility
- Account-level leverage limits
- Position-size calculations with margin requirements
- Real-time margin monitoring and alerts

### 2. Advanced Order Types

#### Order Type Extensions

```typescript
interface ForexOrderTypes {
  OCO: OneCanCelsOtherOrder;
  TrailingStop: TrailingStopOrder;
  IfThenOrder: ConditionalOrder;
  GoodTillCancelled: GTCOrder;
  GoodTillDate: GTDOrder;
}

interface OneCanCelsOtherOrder {
  primaryOrder: ForexOrder;
  secondaryOrder: ForexOrder;
  linkageType: "OCO" | "OTO"; // One-Cancels-Other or One-Triggers-Other
}
```

#### Professional Order Management

- Bracket orders with take profit and stop loss
- Trailing stops with pip-based increments
- Time-based order expiration
- Fill-or-kill and immediate-or-cancel orders

### 3. Currency Correlation Analysis

#### Correlation Matrix

```typescript
interface CurrencyCorrelation {
  basePair: string;
  correlatedPairs: {
    symbol: string;
    correlation: number; // -1 to 1
    strength: "Strong" | "Moderate" | "Weak";
    timeframe: "1H" | "4H" | "1D" | "1W";
  }[];
}
```

#### Risk Assessment

- Portfolio correlation risk analysis
- Currency exposure monitoring
- Diversification recommendations
- Hedging strategy suggestions

### 4. Carry Trade Analysis

#### Interest Rate Differential Tracking

```typescript
interface CarryTradeOpportunity {
  currencyPair: string;
  interestRateDifferential: number;
  annualizedCarry: number;
  riskAdjustedReturn: number;
  volatilityRisk: number;
  recommendationScore: number;
}
```

#### Carry Trade Features
