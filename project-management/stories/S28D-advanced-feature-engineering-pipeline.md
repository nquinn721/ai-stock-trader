## Implementation Details

### Feature Categories

#### Price Features

- Moving averages (SMA, EMA) for multiple periods
- Price position relative to moving averages
- High/low ratios and percentile positions
- Price change rates across multiple timeframes

#### Volume Features

- Volume-weighted average price (VWAP)
- On-balance volume (OBV)
- Volume ratios and anomalies
- Accumulation/distribution line

#### Technical Indicators

- Momentum: RSI, Williams %R, CCI
- Trend: MACD, moving average convergence
- Volatility: Bollinger Bands, ATR
- Oscillators: Stochastic, Ultimate Oscillator

#### Market Regime Features

- Trend detection (up/down/sideways)
- Market regime classification (bullish/bearish/neutral)
- Volatility clustering analysis

### API Interface

```typescript
interface FeaturePipelineService {
  extractFeatures(
    marketData: MarketDataPoint[],
    symbol: string,
    config?: FeaturePipelineConfig
  ): Promise<FeatureSet[]>;

  extractFeaturesRealTime(
    symbol: string,
    config?: FeaturePipelineConfig
  ): Observable<FeatureSet>;

  validateFeatures(featureSet: FeatureSet): FeatureValidationResult;

  getFeatureImportance(symbol: string): Promise<FeatureImportance[]>;
}
```

### Configuration Options

```typescript
interface FeaturePipelineConfig {
  timeframes: string[]; // ['1m', '5m', '15m', '1h', '1d']
  indicators: string[]; // List of indicators to calculate
  lookbackPeriods: number[]; // [10, 20, 50, 100, 200]
  enableRealTime: boolean; // Enable WebSocket streaming
  batchSize: number; // Processing batch size
  cacheFeatures: boolean; // Enable feature caching
  validateQuality: boolean; // Enable feature validation
}
```

## Performance Requirements

- **Processing Speed**: <100ms for 200 data points per symbol
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient handling of 1000+ symbols
- **Real-time Latency**: <50ms for feature updates
- **Accuracy**: Feature calculations validated against reference implementations
