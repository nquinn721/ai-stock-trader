## Description

Create comprehensive ML-based trading recommendations system integrating ALL implemented indicators and analysis. The system will generate real-time BUY/SELL/HOLD/WATCH recommendations with confidence scores, entry/exit price levels, risk parameters, detailed reasoning, and multi-timeframe analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Recommendation Engine

- [ ] Integrate all technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, SMA/EMA, Stochastic, Williams %R, ATR, Volatility)
- [ ] Integrate volume analysis (VWAP, volume spikes, trend analysis, confirmation)
- [ ] Integrate support/resistance levels (multi-level identification, pivot points, breakout detection)
- [ ] Integrate pattern recognition (candlestick patterns, chart patterns with AI confidence)
- [ ] Integrate breakout analysis (trend direction, volatility confirmation, momentum scoring)

### Advanced ML Integration

- [ ] Integration with S29 ML ensemble system (Neural Networks, SVM, LSTM, Transformers)
- [ ] Mean reversion vs momentum scoring
- [ ] Fractal dimension analysis
- [ ] Hurst exponent calculation
- [ ] Volatility clustering detection

### News & Sentiment Analysis

- [ ] Real-time news fetching and analysis
- [ ] Financial sentiment lexicon processing (50+ terms)
- [ ] Social sentiment scoring
- [ ] News impact correlation with price movements

### Risk Management Integration

- [ ] Dynamic position sizing recommendations
- [ ] Stop-loss/take-profit level calculation
- [ ] Risk/reward ratio optimization
- [ ] Portfolio correlation analysis

### Market Microstructure

- [ ] Bid-ask spread proxy calculation
- [ ] Order flow inference
- [ ] Market structure analysis
- [ ] Relative strength calculations

### Real-time Recommendations API

- [ ] BUY/SELL/HOLD/WATCH recommendation generation
- [ ] Confidence scores (0-1 scale)
- [ ] Entry/exit price level recommendations
- [ ] Risk parameter calculations
- [ ] Detailed reasoning and explanation
- [ ] Multi-timeframe analysis (1m/5m/1h/1d)

### System Integration

- [ ] Integration with 8 core modules (breakout, ml-analysis, news, trading, stock, order-management, paper-trading, websocket)
- [ ] WebSocket real-time updates
- [ ] RESTful API endpoints
- [ ] Performance optimization for real-time processing

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture

- TypeScript/NestJS recommendation service
- Integration with existing ML ensemble system (S29D)
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- RESTful API with comprehensive endpoints
- Modular and extensible design

### Performance Requirements

- Real-time recommendation generation (< 1 second)
- Support for multiple concurrent users
- Efficient data processing and caching
- Scalable for high-frequency updates

### Data Integration

- Integration with all existing technical analysis services
- Real-time market data processing
- News and sentiment data integration
- Historical data analysis capabilities

## Dependencies
