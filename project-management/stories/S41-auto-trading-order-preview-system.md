# S41: Auto Trading Order Preview System

## üìã Story Description

Build a comprehensive order preview system that shows pending auto trading orders before execution, allowing users to see anticipated buy/sell prices, quantities, and advanced order parameters (stop-loss, take-profit) before trades are executed. This system will create daily orders that automatically expire at market close if not executed.

## üéØ Business Goals

- **Primary**: Provide transparency into auto trading decisions before execution
- **Secondary**: Allow users to review and approve/reject pending auto trades
- **Tertiary**: Implement daily order lifecycle management with EOD cleanup
