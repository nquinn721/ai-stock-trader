**Sprint**: 3  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Assignee**: Unassigned  
**Dependencies**: Story 010, Story 011

## 📖 User Story

**As a** trader  
**I want** real-time trading signals generated automatically  
**So that** I can make timely trading decisions based on ML analysis

## 📋 Description

Build a real-time signal generation system that processes live market data, applies ML models, and generates actionable trading signals with confidence scores and risk assessments.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Process real-time market data with < 100ms latency
- [ ] Generate signals using trained ML models
- [ ] Include confidence scores (0-1) for each signal
- [ ] Provide signal types: BUY, SELL, HOLD
- [ ] Add risk assessment and position sizing recommendations
- [ ] Implement signal filtering and ranking
- [ ] Create WebSocket API for real-time signal delivery
- [ ] Add signal history and performance tracking

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Signal Generation Pipeline

```
Market Data → Feature Extraction → ML Inference → Signal Generation → Risk Assessment → Signal Delivery
```

### Signal Structure

```typescript
interface TradingSignal {
  id: string;
  symbol: string;
  type: "BUY" | "SELL" | "HOLD";
  confidence: number; // 0.0 - 1.0
  timestamp: Date;
  features: FeatureSet;
  riskScore: number; // 0.0 - 1.0
  positionSize: number; // Recommended position size
  stopLoss?: number;
  takeProfit?: number;
  metadata: {
    model: string;
    version: string;
    strategy: string;
  };
}
```
