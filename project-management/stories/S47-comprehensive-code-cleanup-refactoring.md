## Description

This comprehensive cleanup initiative will systematically review and clean up the entire codebase to improve maintainability, reduce technical debt, and ensure optimal performance. The cleanup must be performed carefully to avoid breaking any existing functionality.

## Scope

### 1. Dead Code Removal

- **Backend Analysis**:
  - Scan all TypeScript files for unused functions, methods, classes
  - Remove unused service methods and controller endpoints
  - Clean up unused interfaces and types
  - Remove commented-out code blocks
  - Identify unused database entities and DTOs

- **Frontend Analysis**:
  - Remove unused React components and hooks
  - Clean up unused utility functions
  - Remove unused context providers and stores
  - Eliminate unused CSS classes and styles
  - Remove unused constants and configurations

### 2. Unused File Cleanup

- **File Discovery**:
  - Identify completely unused components, services, and modules
  - Find orphaned test files without corresponding source files
  - Locate unused asset files (images, icons, fonts)
  - Identify unused configuration files
  - Find duplicate or redundant files

- **Safe Removal Process**:
  - Verify no imports or references exist
  - Check for dynamic imports or string-based references
  - Ensure no build-time dependencies
  - Remove from git history if appropriate

### 3. File Naming Standards

- **Backend Standardization**:
  - Ensure consistent kebab-case for file names
  - Proper service/controller/module naming
  - Consistent test file naming (.spec.ts)
  - Proper DTO and entity naming conventions

- **Frontend Standardization**:
  - PascalCase for React components
  - camelCase for utility files and hooks
  - Consistent CSS file naming
  - Proper test file naming (.test.tsx)

### 4. Import Optimization

- **Cleanup Tasks**:
  - Remove unused imports across all files
  - Optimize import statements for better tree-shaking
  - Group imports logically (external → internal → relative)
  - Use absolute imports where appropriate
  - Remove duplicate imports

### 5. Code Organization

- **Directory Structure**:
  - Ensure logical grouping of related files
  - Move misplaced files to appropriate directories
  - Create consistent folder structures
  - Organize shared utilities properly
  - Group related components and services

### 6. Type Safety Improvements

- **TypeScript Enhancements**:
  - Add missing type annotations
  - Remove 'any' types where possible
  - Ensure proper interface usage
  - Add generic types for better type safety
  - Fix type inconsistencies

### 7. Documentation Cleanup

- **Documentation Tasks**:
  - Remove outdated comments and TODOs
  - Add missing JSDoc comments for public APIs
  - Update README files where necessary
  - Clean up inline comments
  - Document complex algorithms and business logic

### 8. Dependency Cleanup

- **Package Management**:
  - Remove unused npm packages from package.json
  - Update outdated dependencies (with testing)
  - Consolidate duplicate dependencies
  - Review and optimize bundle size
  - Clean up devDependencies vs dependencies

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis & Discovery (2 story points)

1. **Automated Analysis**:
   - Use tools like `depcheck` for unused dependencies
   - Use `ts-unused-exports` for unused exports
   - Run ESLint rules for unused variables
   - Use `unimported` to find unused files

2. **Manual Review**:
   - Code walkthrough of major modules
   - Identify architectural inconsistencies
   - Document findings and cleanup candidates

### Phase 2: Safe Cleanup (8 story points)

1. **Unused Code Removal**:
   - Start with clearly unused imports
   - Remove unused utility functions
   - Clean up unused types and interfaces
   - Remove dead code branches

2. **File Cleanup**:
   - Remove completely unused files
   - Consolidate duplicate files
   - Rename files to follow conventions
   - Update all references to renamed files

3. **Dependency Cleanup**:
   - Remove unused npm packages
   - Update package.json files
   - Test after each dependency change

### Phase 3: Organization & Standards (3 story points)

1. **Code Organization**:
   - Reorganize misplaced files
   - Create consistent directory structures
   - Group related functionality

2. **Type Safety & Documentation**:
   - Add missing types
   - Update documentation
   - Add JSDoc comments

- [ ] Outdated comments are removed
- [ ] API documentation is current

## Tools & Techniques

### Automated Tools

```bash
# Find unused dependencies
npx depcheck

# Find unused exports
npx ts-unused-exports tsconfig.json

# Find unused files
npx unimported

# ESLint unused variables
npx eslint --fix

# Bundle analyzer
npx webpack-bundle-analyzer
```

### Manual Review Process

1. **File-by-file review** of critical modules
2. **Import analysis** using IDE tools
3. **Git blame analysis** to understand code history
4. **Reference counting** for components and services

## Risk Mitigation

### Safety Measures

- [ ] Create comprehensive backup before starting
- [ ] Work in small, incremental commits
- [ ] Run full test suite after each major change
- [ ] Test application functionality manually
- [ ] Use feature branches for major cleanups

### Rollback Plan

- [ ] Maintain detailed change log
- [ ] Tag stable versions before cleanup
- [ ] Prepare rollback scripts if needed
- [ ] Document all file moves and renames

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing

- [ ] All unit tests must pass
- [ ] All integration tests must pass
- [ ] All E2E tests must pass
- [ ] Build process must complete successfully

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Core user flows must work
- [ ] All pages must load without errors
- [ ] WebSocket connections must function
- [ ] API endpoints must respond correctly

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

- **Reduced file count**: Target 10-15% reduction in total files
- **Import optimization**: Zero unused imports
- **Bundle size**: Maintain or reduce current bundle size
- **Build time**: Maintain or improve build performance
- **Test coverage**: Maintain or improve current coverage

### Qualitative Metrics

- **Code maintainability**: Easier to navigate and understand
- **Developer experience**: Faster development and debugging
- **Code consistency**: Uniform naming and organization
- **Documentation quality**: Clear and current documentation

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Analysis and discovery phase
- **Week 2-3**: Core cleanup and file removal
- **Week 4**: Organization, documentation, and testing

## Dependencies

None - this is a foundational improvement that will benefit all other stories.

## Notes

- This cleanup should be performed before major new feature development
- All changes must be thoroughly tested to prevent regressions
- Focus on gradual, safe improvements rather than aggressive changes
- Maintain backward compatibility for any public APIs
- Document all major changes for team reference
