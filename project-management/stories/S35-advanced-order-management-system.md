## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Backend Services

```typescript
// Order Management Service
@Injectable()
export class OrderManagementService {
  async createOrder(orderDto: CreateOrderDto): Promise<Order> {
    // Validate order parameters
    // Check account buying power
    // Execute risk management rules
    // Submit order for execution
  }

  async modifyOrder(orderId: number, updates: Partial<Order>): Promise<Order> {
    // Validate modification request
    // Cancel existing order
    // Create modified order
    // Update order tracking
  }

  async cancelOrder(orderId: number): Promise<void> {
    // Cancel order in execution system
    // Update order status
    // Release allocated buying power
    // Notify user of cancellation
  }

  async executeConditionalOrders(): Promise<void> {
    // Check all pending conditional orders
    // Evaluate trigger conditions
    // Execute triggered orders
    // Update conditional order status
  }
}

// Order Execution Engine
@Injectable()
export class OrderExecutionEngine {
  async executeMarketOrder(order: Order): Promise<ExecutionResult> {
    // Get current market price
    // Execute at best available price
    // Handle partial fills
    // Update position and cash balance
  }

  async executeLimitOrder(order: Order): Promise<ExecutionResult> {
    // Check if limit price is available
    // Execute at limit price or better
    // Queue order if not executable
    // Monitor for execution opportunities
  }
}
```

### Frontend Components

```typescript
// Order Entry Component
const OrderEntry: React.FC<OrderEntryProps> = ({ symbol, portfolioId }) => {
  return (
    <div className="order-entry">
      <OrderTypeSelector />
      <QuantityInput />
      <PriceInputs />
      <BracketOrderSettings />
      <RiskValidation />
      <OrderSubmitButton />
    </div>
  );
};

// Order Management Dashboard
const OrderManagement: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="order-management">
      <ActiveOrdersList />
      <OrderHistory />
      <ConditionalOrders />
      <ExecutionQuality />
    </div>
  );
