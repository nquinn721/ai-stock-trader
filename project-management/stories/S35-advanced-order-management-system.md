## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Backend Services

```typescript
// Order Management Service
@Injectable()
export class OrderManagementService {
  async createOrder(orderDto: CreateOrderDto): Promise<Order> {
    // Validate order parameters
    // Check account buying power
    // Execute risk management rules
    // Submit order for execution
  }

  async modifyOrder(orderId: number, updates: Partial<Order>): Promise<Order> {
    // Validate modification request
    // Cancel existing order
    // Create modified order
    // Update order tracking
  }

  async cancelOrder(orderId: number): Promise<void> {
    // Cancel order in execution system
    // Update order status
    // Release allocated buying power
    // Notify user of cancellation
  }

  async executeConditionalOrders(): Promise<void> {
    // Check all pending conditional orders
    // Evaluate trigger conditions
    // Execute triggered orders
    // Update conditional order status
  }
}

// Order Execution Engine
@Injectable()
export class OrderExecutionEngine {
  async executeMarketOrder(order: Order): Promise<ExecutionResult> {
    // Get current market price
    // Execute at best available price
    // Handle partial fills
    // Update position and cash balance
  }

  async executeLimitOrder(order: Order): Promise<ExecutionResult> {
    // Check if limit price is available
    // Execute at limit price or better
    // Queue order if not executable
    // Monitor for execution opportunities
  }
}
```

### Frontend Components

```typescript
// Order Entry Component
const OrderEntry: React.FC<OrderEntryProps> = ({ symbol, portfolioId }) => {
  return (
    <div className="order-entry">
      <OrderTypeSelector />
      <QuantityInput />
      <PriceInputs />
      <BracketOrderSettings />
      <RiskValidation />
      <OrderSubmitButton />
    </div>
  );
};

// Order Management Dashboard
const OrderManagement: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="order-management">
      <ActiveOrdersList />
      <OrderHistory />
      <ConditionalOrders />
      <ExecutionQuality />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## üé® UI/UX Requirements

- **Order Entry Interface**: Clean, professional order ticket design
- **Visual Order Ladder**: Interactive price level display with order placement
- **Real-time Updates**: Live order status and execution notifications
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly order entry on mobile devices
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid orders
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Safety confirmations for large orders

## üìä Success Metrics

- Order execution latency < 100ms for market orders
- Order accuracy rate > 99.9%
- System uptime > 99.5% during market hours
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5 for order interface
- Zero critical order execution bugs

## üîÑ Dependencies

- Requires S30C (Automated Trading System Backend) completion
- Needs real-time market data integration
- Depends on portfolio service for buying power calculations
- Requires WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates

## üö® Risk Management

- Implement circuit breakers for unusual order activity
- Validate all orders against account equity and positions
- Maintain audit trail for all order activities
- Implement order size limits and concentration checks

## üìù Implementation Notes

This story creates the foundation for professional-grade trading capabilities, enabling users to implement sophisticated trading strategies with institutional-quality order management tools. The system should be designed for high reliability and performance during market hours.
