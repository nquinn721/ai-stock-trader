## Vision Statement

Build a comprehensive multi-asset trading platform that supports isolated paper trading across Stock, Forex, and Cryptocurrency markets while ensuring strict account segregation and preventing cross-contamination of trading activities.

## Business Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Multi-Asset Support**: Enable trading across three major asset classes (Stock, Forex, Crypto)
2. **Account Isolation**: Ensure complete segregation between different asset class accounts

- **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for account validation systems
- **Trading Volume Growth**: 40% increase in total trading volume across all assets
- **Compliance Score**: 100% compliance with segregation requirements

## Market Need

### Current State

- Paper trading system only supports stock assets
- No segregation between different asset classes
- Limited automated trading capabilities for alternative assets
- Risk of unintended cross-asset trading activities

### Target State

- Dedicated isolated accounts for Stock, Forex, and Crypto trading
- Strict API-level validation preventing cross-contamination
- Asset-class specific trading interfaces and risk management
- Foundation for multi-asset automated trading strategies

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Account Isolation Service

- Manages creation and lifecycle of asset-class specific accounts
- Enforces strict isolation rules at database and API levels
- Validates all trading operations against account permissions

#### 2. Multi-Asset Portfolio Management

- Extends existing portfolio system with asset class support
- Implements separate balance tracking per asset class
- Provides unified performance reporting across asset classes

#### 3. Asset-Specific Trading Services

- **Forex Service**: Currency pair trading with pip calculation
- **Crypto Service**: Digital asset trading with precision handling
- **Stock Service**: Enhanced existing service with isolation support

#### 4. Data Provider Integration

- **Forex Data**: Alpha Vantage, Fixer.io integration
- **Crypto Data**: CoinGecko, Binance API integration
- **Real-time Feeds**: WebSocket data streams per asset class

### Database Design

```sql
-- Asset class enumeration
ENUM AssetClass ('STOCK', 'FOREX', 'CRYPTO')

-- Extended portfolio table
portfolios:
  - asset_class: AssetClass
  - base_currency: VARCHAR(3)
  - is_isolated: BOOLEAN
  - UNIQUE(user_id, asset_class, account_type)

-- Asset-specific trading pairs
forex_pairs:
  - base_currency, quote_currency
  - pip_size, lot_size_limits

crypto_pairs:
  - base_asset, quote_asset
  - precision_limits, order_size_limits
```

### API Design

```typescript
// Account Management
GET    /api/paper-trading/accounts
POST   /api/paper-trading/accounts
GET    /api/paper-trading/accounts/:assetClass

// Asset-Specific Trading
GET    /api/forex/pairs
POST   /api/forex/orders
GET    /api/crypto/pairs
POST   /api/crypto/orders

// Isolation Validation
POST   /api/paper-trading/validate-trade
GET    /api/paper-trading/isolation-status
```

## User Experience Design

### Multi-Asset Dashboard

- Overview of all asset class accounts
- Quick switching between asset classes
- Unified performance metrics
- Asset-class specific trading interfaces

### Account Creation Flow

1. **Asset Class Selection**: Choose Stock, Forex, or Crypto
2. **Account Configuration**: Set initial balance and currency
3. **Risk Parameters**: Configure asset-specific risk limits
4. **Confirmation**: Review isolation rules and create account

### Trading Interface

- **Context-Aware**: Automatically detects asset class from symbol
- **Account Validation**: Prevents orders in wrong asset class account
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear indication of current active account
- **Seamless Switching**: Easy transition between asset classes

## Risk Management

### Account Isolation Rules

1. **One Account Per Asset Class**: Each user limited to one account per asset type
2. **Cross-Asset Prevention**: API blocks trades in wrong asset class
3. **Balance Segregation**: Complete financial isolation between accounts
4. **Performance Isolation**: Separate P&L tracking per asset class

### Asset-Specific Controls

- **Forex**: Leverage limits, margin requirements, pip-based stop losses
- **Crypto**: Volatility-based position sizing, precision validation
- **Stock**: Traditional equity risk controls with enhanced isolation

### Compliance & Security

- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history per asset class
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Financial industry segregation standards
- **Data Security**: Encrypted storage of account information
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions per asset class
