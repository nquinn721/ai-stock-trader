# Deployment Configuration

## Active Deployment Files

### Google Cloud Run (Primary Deployment)

- **`cloudbuild.yaml`** - Cloud Build configuration for automated deployment
- **`Dockerfile.cloudrun`** - Production Docker image with embedded frontend
- **`.gcloudignore`** - Files excluded from Cloud Build uploads
- **`.dockerignore`** - Files excluded from Docker builds

### Development Scripts

- **`scripts/build-production.sh`** - Build production artifacts
- **`scripts/setup-database.sh`** - Database initialization
- **`scripts/setup-project.sh`** - Project setup automation

## Current Deployment Architecture

The application uses a **single-container approach** where:

- NestJS backend serves both API endpoints and React frontend
- Frontend is built and served as static files from the backend
- WebSocket connections work through the same origin
- Database is Cloud SQL MySQL

## Deployment Commands

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml

# Check deployment status
gcloud run services describe stock-trading-app --region=us-central1
```

### Development

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Start development servers
npm run dev:start
```

## Removed Files

The following unused deployment configurations have been removed:

- Multiple unused Dockerfiles (Dockerfile, Dockerfile.simple, etc.)
- Alternative deployment platforms (app.yaml, render.yaml, vercel.json, k8s)
- Redundant Cloud Build configs (cloudbuild-backend.yaml, cloudbuild-simple.yaml)
- Docker Compose configurations (no longer needed)
- Nginx configurations (frontend embedded in backend)
- Local production setup scripts (use Cloud Run instead)
