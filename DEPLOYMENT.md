# Deployment Configuration

## Active Deployment Files

### Google Cloud Run (Primary Deployment)

- **`cloudbuild.yaml`** - Cloud Build configuration for automated deployment
- **`Dockerfile.cloudrun`** - Production Docker image with embedded frontend
- **`.gcloudignore`** - Files excluded from Cloud Build uploads
- **`.dockerignore`** - Files excluded from Docker builds

### Development Scripts

- **`scripts/build-production.sh`** - Build production artifacts
- **`scripts/setup-database.sh`** - Database initialization
- **`scripts/setup-project.sh`** - Project setup automation

## Current Deployment Architecture

The application uses a **single-container approach** where:

- NestJS backend serves both API endpoints and React frontend
- Frontend is built and served as static files from the backend
- WebSocket connections work through the same origin
- Database is Cloud SQL MySQL

## Deployment Commands

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml

# Check deployment status
gcloud run services describe stock-trading-app --region=us-central1
```

### Development

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Start development servers
npm run dev:start
```

## Removed Files

The following unused deployment configurations have been removed:

- Multiple unused Dockerfiles (Dockerfile, Dockerfile.simple, etc.)
- Alternative deployment platforms (app.yaml, render.yaml, vercel.json, k8s)
- Redundant Cloud Build configs (cloudbuild-backend.yaml, cloudbuild-simple.yaml)
- Docker Compose configurations (no longer needed)
- Nginx configurations (frontend embedded in backend)
- Local production setup scripts (use Cloud Run instead)

## Autonomous Trading Production Status

### âœ… Re-enabled Modules (June 29, 2025)

All autonomous trading modules have been **re-enabled in production**:

- **`AutoTradingModule`** - Core autonomous trading functionality
- **`BehavioralFinanceModule`** - Psychology-driven trading insights
- **`MarketMakingModule`** - Liquidity provision and market making
- **`DataIntelligenceModule`** - Advanced data analytics
- **`EconomicIntelligenceModule`** - Macro-economic analysis
- **`MultiAssetModule`** - Multi-asset trading capabilities

### âœ… WebSocket Notifications Re-enabled

Previously commented-out WebSocket notifications for autonomous trading are now active:

- Trading session start/stop notifications
- Trade execution alerts
- ML signal notifications
- Emergency stop triggers

### âœ… ML Signal Generation

- Advanced signal generation re-enabled for each portfolio stock
- High-confidence signals (>85% strength) trigger trading actions
- WebSocket notifications for ML signals working correctly

### ðŸ”’ Production Safety Features

The following features remain **intentionally disabled** for production safety:

- Real exchange adapters (Binance, Coinbase) - prevents accidental live trading
- Direct market order execution - uses paper trading simulation
- External API key configurations for real trading platforms

### Deployment Status

- **Backend**: All modules building successfully âœ…
- **Database**: All entities properly configured âœ…
- **WebSocket**: Real-time notifications working âœ…
- **Health Checks**: Endpoints responding correctly âœ…
