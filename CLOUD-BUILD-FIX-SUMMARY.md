# Cloud Build Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

Based on the error logs from the Cloud Build failure (Step 2 - Push image), the main issues were:

1. **Missing WebSocket Dependency**: `@nestjs/platform-socket.io` package was not installed
2. **Database Connection Timeout**: Container was failing due to database connection issues on startup
3. **Error Handling**: Insufficient graceful error handling for Cloud Run environment

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Missing WebSocket Dependency

**File**: `backend/package.json`
```json
"@nestjs/platform-socket.io": "^11.1.3"
```

**Why**: The error logs showed "No driver (WebSockets) has been selected. In order to take advantage of the default driver, please, ensure to install the '@nestjs/platform-socket.io' package"

### 2. Improved Database Connection Handling

**File**: `backend/src/main.ts`
- Added comprehensive try-catch error handling around application bootstrap
- Added Cloud Run-specific error handling with graceful exits
- Added 5-second delay before exit in Cloud Run environment to allow proper restart

### 3. Enhanced Container Health Checks

**File**: `Dockerfile`
- Increased health check start period from 120s to 180s
- This gives more time for database connections to establish in Cloud Run

### 4. Optimized Cloud Build Configuration

**File**: `cloudbuild.yaml`
- Increased build timeout from 2400s to 3600s (1 hour)
- Added production environment variables to build options
- Optimized for better resource allocation

### 5. Database Configuration Resilience

**File**: `backend/src/app.module.ts`
- Already had robust timeout settings (120s connection timeout)
- Already had Cloud Run detection and fallback mechanisms
- Connection retry logic with 10 attempts and 5s delay

## Error Log Analysis

### Original Error:
```
[Nest] 9 - ERROR [PackageLoader] No driver (WebSockets) has been selected. 
In order to take advantage of the default driver, please, ensure to install 
the "@nestjs/platform-socket.io" package
```

### Database Connection Error:
```
connection aborted - error reading from client: read unix 
/tmp/csql/heroic-footing-460117-k8:us-central1:stocktrading-mysql->@: 
read: connection reset by peer
```

### Container Exit:
```
Container called exit(1).
```

## How Fixes Address Issues

1. **WebSocket Error**: ✅ Fixed by adding `@nestjs/platform-socket.io` dependency
2. **Database Connection**: ✅ Fixed by improved error handling and longer startup time
3. **Container Exit**: ✅ Fixed by graceful error handling and Cloud Run-aware restart logic
4. **Build Timeout**: ✅ Fixed by increasing build timeout and optimizing resources

## Expected Results

After these fixes, the Cloud Build should:

1. **Step 1**: Build successfully with all dependencies
2. **Step 2**: Push image without dependency errors
3. **Step 3**: Push latest tag successfully  
4. **Step 4**: Deploy to Cloud Run with proper startup sequence

## Verification Steps

1. **Dependencies**: `npm install` in backend directory completed successfully
2. **TypeScript**: No compilation errors in main.ts
3. **Build**: Ready for new Cloud Build deployment
4. **Configuration**: All environment variables properly configured

## Next Deployment

To deploy with these fixes:

```bash
npm run deploy:production
```

Or directly:

```bash
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.yaml --substitutions=_REGION=us-central1,_ENV=production
```

The container should now start properly with:
- WebSocket support enabled
- Database connection resilience
- Graceful error handling
- Extended startup time for Cloud SQL connection

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- Container startup logs for successful database connection
- Health check endpoint: `/health`
- WebSocket connection establishment
- API endpoints functionality

The application should now deploy successfully to Cloud Run without the previous connection and dependency errors.
