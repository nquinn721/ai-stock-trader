- trading_sessions (session tracking)
```

## Risk Assessment

### S30A (Testing) - Medium Risk

- **Risk**: Large codebase complexity
- **Mitigation**: Incremental approach, focus on critical paths

### S30B (MobX) - High Risk

- **Risk**: Major architectural change
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing first, incremental migration

### S30C (Backend Trading) - High Risk

- **Risk**: Financial implications, complex rule engine
- **Mitigation**: Extensive testing, paper trading mode, emergency stops

### S30D (Frontend Trading) - Medium Risk

- **Risk**: Complex UI state management
- **Mitigation**: User testing, clear visual indicators, safety confirmations

## Dependencies and Sequencing

```
S30A (Testing) → S30B (MobX) → S30C (Backend) → S30D (Frontend)
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
  Foundation    Architecture    Intelligence   User Experience
```

**Critical Path**: Each ticket depends on the previous one for stability and architecture foundations.

## Notes

- **Financial Safety**: Automated trading involves real money - comprehensive testing is mandatory
- **User Experience**: Trading interface must be intuitive with clear safety controls
- **Performance**: Real-time data processing requires optimized state management
- **Scalability**: System must handle multiple portfolios and trading sessions simultaneously
- **Compliance**: Consider regulatory requirements for automated trading systems
